The purpose of this lab was to implement a message onto the ATmega32Uâ€™s (hereby referred to as MC)
LCD screen using data transfers, an LCD driver program. Additional functionality included the ability to clear the
LCD screen and scroll the message across the screen left to right. The main data transfer method used in this lab
was from program memory to data memory (this transfer requires an intermediary register, which was the main
difficulty in this lab). This lab was supposed to introduce the students to multi-stage data transfer to implement a
visual result (text on the LCD screen).
