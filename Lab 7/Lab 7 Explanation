The purpose of this lab was to implement a game of rock paper scissors between two Atmega32U4
microcontrollers using USART (asynchronous mode) communication protocol. This lab also instructs the students
to manipulate data memory (specifically of the data memory corresponding to the LCD display), move data from
program memory to data memory, and to implement a normal mode counter using the 16 bit timer/counter 1. The
students must also either use interrupts or polling for 4 separate events: data reception, data transmission, and
two button inputs. The LCD screen should display different messages based on which portion of the game is
currently being played, including a start message, a win/lose message, and the opponentâ€™s gesture. 

My implementation of this lab uses polling for UART transmission and interrupts for UART reception and button inputs.
