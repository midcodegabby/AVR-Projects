The purpose of this lab was to introduce the students to external interrupts and how to use them. In this
lab, students were to use external interrupts to perform the same task as the Lab1 and Lab2 Programs (basic
Bumpbot behavior). Three interrupts were used in this lab: INT3, INT1, and INT0. There were two interrupts for the
button inputs (left whisker and right whisker hit), and one to clear the LCD counter. Another part of this lab was to
display the left and right whisker hit counters on the LCD screen.
