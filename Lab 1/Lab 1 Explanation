The purpose of this lab is to familiarize students with assembly code, and its complexity/relation to the C
programming language. This is done by having students implement small changes to a pre-existing assembly
program, building that program into a hex file, and then testing it by downloading it onto the ATmega32U (called
MC from now on) Microcontroller. Then the students must complete the same task as the assembly program but
in C from scratch. The contrast between the two implementations allows the students to understand how C can be
abstracted into assembly, and how C runs “under the hood”. Another purpose of this lab is to learn how to interact
with the IDE used for programming the ATmega32U (specifically, converting a .asm file to hex by building it), and
file management within that IDE.
