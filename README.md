# AVR-Projects-Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language-Programming-
This repository contains the assembly projects I wrote for my Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming class. 

Lab 7 is the portfolio project for this class. Lab 7 is an implementation of a game of rock paper scissors played between two Atmega32U microcontrollers using UART communication.
